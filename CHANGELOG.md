  - Replaces 4 separate README functions with single consistent interface
  - Saved ~80 lines of duplicate README update code
  - Consistent commit messages and error handling

### Fixed
- **Progress UI Hanging at 0% and Not Completing**
  - **Root cause**: HTTP client buffers entire file before upload, causing all progress updates to happen at once, overwhelming the channel
  - **Progress throttling**: ProgressReader now sends updates every 1MB instead of every 16KB, reducing messages from ~1060 to ~17 for a 17MB file
  - **Increased channel buffer**: Raised from 10 to 50 to handle burst updates without dropping
  - **Removed timeout race condition**: `waitForProgress` now blocks on channel indefinitely instead of using 100ms timeout that could miss final messages
  - **Separate tick for UI responsiveness**: Independent tickCmd keeps UI refreshing while waiting for progress
  - **Result**: Progress bar updates smoothly and exits cleanly when complete
  - Shows "Connecting to GitHub..." message before progress bar to explain initial delay during connection establishment
  - Ctrl+C properly cancels uploads/downloads and returns cancellation error
- **Multi-Select Book Picker Only Showing One Item**
  - Multi-select book picker now properly handles window resize events
  - Previously displayed only one item at a time due to 0x0 list dimensions
  - Now calculates proper dimensions accounting for border frame size
  - Affects delete-book and move-book commands in TUI mode
- **Batch Delete Confirmation Always Failing**
  - Fixed confirmation prompt to read full phrase "DELETE N BOOKS"
  - Previously used `fmt.Scanln()` which stopped at first space, only capturing "DELETE"
  - Now uses `bufio.ReadString('\n')` to read complete line including spaces
  - Batch deletions now work correctly after user confirmation
- **README Update Warnings for Unchanged Content**
  - Skip README commits when content hasn't actually changed
  - Eliminates spurious "nothing to commit, working tree clean" warnings
  - Affects updateREADMEAfterRemove, updateREADMEAfterAdd, and updateREADME functions
  - Books that aren't in "Recently Added" section no longer trigger warnings
- **Apostrophes and Quotes in Book IDs**
  - slugify() now removes apostrophes and quotes instead of converting them to hyphens
  - "Let's Go Further" → "lets-go-further" (was: "let-s-go-further")
  - Handles ASCII quotes (', "), smart quotes (' ' " "), and curly quotes
  - Added test cases for apostrophes, quotes, and possessives
- **UTF-16BE Encoded PDF Metadata Not Decoded Properly**
  - PDF metadata with UTF-16BE encoding (starting with BOM FE FF) now decodes correctly
  - Added UTF-16BE detection and decoding in `decodePDFString()` function
  - Fixes rendering issues like `��` appearing before book titles extracted from PDFs
  - Affects titles like "Let's Go Further" which are UTF-16BE encoded in PDF metadata
  - Added defensive `sanitizeForTerminal()` for converting problematic Unicode characters to ASCII equivalents
