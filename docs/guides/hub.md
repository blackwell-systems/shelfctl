# Interactive Hub

The `shelfctl` hub is an interactive menu that provides a visual interface to all shelfctl operations.

## Launching the Hub

Simply run `shelfctl` with no arguments in a terminal:

```bash
shelfctl
```

This will display an interactive menu showing all available operations.

## Features

### Visual Menu

The hub displays:
- **Main menu** - All available operations (Browse, Add Book, Move, etc.)
- **Status bar** - Number of configured shelves and total books
- **Keyboard navigation** - Use ↑/↓ or j/k to navigate
- **Search** - Press `/` to filter menu items
- **Command palette** - Press `ctrl+p` to fuzzy-search all actions
- **Help** - Shows keybindings at the bottom

### Scrollable Details Panel

When highlighting "View Shelves" or "Cache Info" menu items, the hub displays a details panel on the right side. For large libraries with many shelves or modified books:

- Press `tab` or `→` to focus the details panel
- Use `↑`/`↓` or `j`/`k` to scroll through content
- Press `←` or `esc` to return focus to the menu
- Focused panel shows thick cyan border and scroll position indicator
- Menu border dims when details panel is focused

This allows you to review all your shelves or cache statistics without truncation, even if the list extends beyond one screen.

### Available Operations

The hub provides access to all core operations and loops continuously until you quit:

**Browse Library**
- Launch the interactive book browser
- View all books across shelves with metadata
- Navigate with keyboard (↑/↓ or j/k)
- Filter and search in real-time (press `/`)
- See cache status (green ✓ for cached books)
- **Interactive Actions:**
  - `enter` - Show detailed book information with cover image (Kitty/Ghostty/iTerm2)
  - `o` - Open book (downloads if needed, opens with system viewer)
  - `space` - Toggle selection (checkboxes appear for multi-select)
  - `g` - Download selected books to cache (or current if none selected)
  - `x` - Remove selected books from cache (or current if none selected)
  - `s` - Sync modified books to GitHub (uploads annotations/highlights)
  - `c` - Clear all selections
  - `tab` - Toggle details panel
  - `q` - Return to hub menu
- **Multi-select workflow:**
  - Press `space` to check books for batch operations
  - Press `g` to download all selected (useful for pre-caching for offline)
  - Press `x` to remove selected from cache (frees disk space, keeps in library)
  - Press `s` to sync modified books back to GitHub (replaces release assets)
- Downloads happen in background with progress bar at bottom
- Books marked as cached when download complete
- Extracts PDF cover thumbnails automatically during download

**Generate HTML Index**

- Returns to hub menu after generation

**Add Book**
- Add a new book with guided workflow
- Shelf picker (if multiple shelves)
- File browser starting in current directory
- Filters for supported formats (.pdf, .epub, .mobi, .djvu)
- Metadata form with smart defaults (auto-extracts title/author from PDFs)
- "Cache locally" checkbox (enabled by default) - book available immediately after upload
- Automatic upload and cataloging
- Returns to hub menu after completion

**Edit Book**
- Interactive book picker followed by metadata form
- Pre-populates form with current values
- Update title, author, year, and tags
- Only updates catalog metadata (asset file unchanged)
- Returns to hub menu after completion
- Hidden when no books exist

**Delete Book**
- Interactive book picker showing all books
- Shows book details before deletion
- Safety confirmation (type book ID to confirm)
- Removes from catalog.yml and deletes GitHub release asset
- Clears from local cache automatically
- Returns to hub menu after completion
- Hidden when no books exist

**Create Shelf**
- Interactive form for adding a new shelf repository
- Collects shelf name and repository name
- Checkboxes for configuration options:
  - Create GitHub repository (default: yes)
  - Make repository private (default: yes)
- Creates repo via GitHub API with 'library' release, generates README.md, adds to config
- No need to exit to CLI or remember `init` command syntax
- Returns to hub menu after completion

**Delete Shelf**
- Interactive shelf picker
- Clear numbered choices:
  - Keep repository (remove from config only)
  - Delete permanently (repository and all books)
- Safety confirmation (type shelf name to confirm)
- Shows exactly what will be deleted
- Returns to hub menu after completion
- Hidden when no shelves exist

**Sync Modified** *(Cache section — only visible when modified books exist)*
- Scans all shelves and lists books whose cached copy differs from the catalog checksum
- Shows full list for confirmation before uploading
- Processes books sequentially: delete old asset → upload modified file → commit catalog
- Displays live ✓/✗ status per book during processing
- Returns to hub with a summary on completion

### Auto-Sync (opt-in)

When `sync.auto_sync: true` is set in your config, the hub will
automatically upload modified books in the background without a
confirmation prompt.

**How it works:**
- After the hub loads (and on each 20-second background scan), shelfctl
  checks for locally modified cached books.
- Any book whose cache file was modified more than `sync.debounce_minutes`
  minutes ago (default: 5) is queued for upload.
- Files modified within the debounce window are skipped and reconsidered
  on the next scan.
- After syncing, the hub shows: `↑ Auto-synced N book(s)`

**Enable auto-sync in your config:**
```yaml
sync:
  auto_sync: true
  debounce_minutes: 5  # optional, default is 5
```

**When to use it:** Best for workflows where you frequently annotate
PDFs and want changes pushed automatically.

**When NOT to use it:** Leave `auto_sync: false` (the default) if you
want explicit control over when files are uploaded.

**Quit**
- Exit shelfctl cleanly

### Additional Commands

All other shelfctl commands remain available via direct invocation:

```bash
shelfctl status          # Library sync status overview
shelfctl search <query>  # Search by title, author, or tags
shelfctl tags            # List tags with counts
shelfctl info <id>       # View book details
shelfctl open <id>       # Open a book
shelfctl move <id>       # Move books between shelves
shelfctl split           # Split a large shelf
shelfctl migrate         # Import from old repos
shelfctl import          # Copy from another shelf
```

Run `shelfctl --help` to see all available commands.

## First Time Use

If you haven't configured any shelves yet, the hub will show a welcome message and offer to guide you through setup:

```bash
$ shelfctl

Welcome to shelfctl!

Setup status:

  ✓ GitHub token configured
  ✗ No shelves configured

Next step: Create your first shelf

Would you like to create a shelf now? (y/n): y

📚 Let's set up your first shelf!

Tip: Type 'help' or '?' at any prompt for detailed guidance

Want to learn about shelf architecture first? (y/n/?): n

This will create a GitHub repository to store your books.

GitHub repository name (e.g., shelf-books) [?=help]: shelf-programming

The shelf name is a short nickname used in commands like:
  shelfctl shelve book.pdf --shelf programming

Shelf name for commands (default: programming) [?=help]:

Summary:
  GitHub repository:  your-username/shelf-programming
  Release tag:        library
  Shelf name (config): programming

You'll use the shelf name in commands: shelfctl shelve --shelf programming

Proceed? (y/n): y
Shelf name (e.g., books): programming

This will create:
  • GitHub repository: your-username/shelf-programming
  • Release tag: library
  • Shelf name: programming

Proceed? (y/n): y

Creating repo your-username/shelf-programming …
✓ Created https://github.com/your-username/shelf-programming

What's next?
  1. Add your first book:
     shelfctl shelve

  2. Or run the interactive menu:
     shelfctl
```

### Setup Status Indicators

The welcome message shows visual status for each requirement:

- ✓ **GitHub token configured** - Token is set and ready
- ✗ **GitHub token not found** - Need to `export SHELFCTL_GITHUB_TOKEN=...`
- ✓ **N shelf(s) configured** - Shelves are set up
- ✗ **No shelves configured** - Need to run `shelfctl init` or accept the guided workflow

## Non-Interactive Mode

The hub requires a terminal (TTY). If you:
- Pipe output: `shelfctl | grep ...`
- Redirect output: `shelfctl > file.txt`
- Use `--no-interactive` flag: `shelfctl --no-interactive`

It will display the standard CLI help instead.

Clean, focused, and functional. The menu dynamically shows only available operations (e.g., "Delete Book" is hidden when no books exist). Menu items are ordered by frequency of use. Additional commands are available via `shelfctl <command>`.

## CLI Compatibility

All operations remain available as direct commands:

```bash
# These work exactly as before
shelfctl browse
shelfctl shelve ~/book.pdf --shelf programming --title "..."
shelfctl info book-id
shelfctl move book-id --to-shelf history

# But now you can also use the hub for a guided experience
shelfctl  # launches interactive menu
```

## Feedback

As you use the hub, consider what would make it more useful:
- Which operations do you use most?
- What information should the status bar show?
- What keyboard shortcuts would be helpful?
- What's confusing or could be clearer?
